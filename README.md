Welcome to the image searcher app!

A layout of the search bar in the app was borrowed from https://freefrontend.com/css-search-boxes

I used all avaliable 4 hours for the development of this app.

Regarding the biggest issue, I would mentioned displaying all the images in a nicely manner on a screen, in the end, due to lack of time, I ended up with just a vertical list of images, but it would be nicier to have a grid with variable cells depending on the size of a picture.
